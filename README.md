Inventory Management App - Flex Business Solutions Tech Test
This is a web application for managing inventory across different job sites, built as a technical test for Flex Business Solutions. The app allows users to view, create, and search for job sites, and manage the inventory specific to each site.

The project follows the design specifications provided in the Figma file.

ü§î Further Considerations
Here are some thoughts on how this application could be improved and scaled in a real-world production environment.

How might you make this app more secure?
There are several layers of security that could be applied to this application:

Authentication & Authorization: Implement a secure login system (e.g., JWT-based auth or OAuth2). Users should only be able to view or modify job sites and inventory if their role permits it. Role-based access control (RBAC) would ensure that, for example, only managers can edit or delete inventory items.

Input Validation & Sanitization: All user inputs (search queries, form data) should be validated on both the frontend and backend. This prevents malicious inputs that could lead to XSS, SQL injection, or other injection-based attacks.

Secure Communication (HTTPS): Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the client and server. This ensures that sensitive data, like user credentials and inventory updates, is encrypted while in transit.

API Security: Protect APIs with measures like rate limiting, request validation, and API keys. This prevents abuse, brute-force attempts, and unauthorized access.

Audit Trails & Logging: Keep a log of who made which changes to inventory items and job sites. This ensures accountability and makes it easier to trace suspicious activity.

How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
To handle very large datasets efficiently, both the frontend and backend would need optimization:

Pagination & Infinite Scrolling: Instead of loading all records at once, data should be fetched in chunks (server-side pagination). On the frontend, an infinite scroll or a "Load More" button would provide a smooth user experience without overwhelming the browser.

Server-Side Search & Filtering: All search and filtering logic should be handled by the database, not the client. This ensures only relevant data is sent over the network. Creating database indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., item name, category, status) would drastically improve query speed.

Caching: Use an in-memory cache like Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., the main job sites list). Caching reduces database load and provides near-instant responses for common queries.

Frontend Performance Optimization: For rendering very long lists, use virtualization (e.g., react-window). This technique only renders the items currently visible on the screen, keeping the UI fast and responsive even with thousands of rows.

Database & Infrastructure Scaling: At a very large scale, you would need to optimize the database schema and potentially use strategies like sharding or read replicas. The backend services should be deployed with a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances (horizontal scaling), ensuring high availability and performance.
